This is a series of tests testing the methods of string

So we will generally have a string like 

>>> name = "Maxwell"

Now let's print it out

>>> name
'Maxwell'

Let's say we'd like to capatalize all the name, we'd use the upper method
And once we do that, we expect that the return of this function would be the
name in all upper case, which is essentially a string.

>>> name.upper()
'MAXWELL'

Remember that this doesn't modify the string in-place, well, that's because a
string is an immutable data type. So we should expect that our original string
is not tampered with

>>> name
'Maxwell'


We could even do slicing

>>> name[0:3]
'Max'


What if we tried to modify the string? Well, a TypeError would occur

>>> name[0] = 'm'
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
